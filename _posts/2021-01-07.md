## Prompt

Why are there various accounts of the first vision?

The basic answer is that he wrote it many times, to different audiences, with different points he wanted to emphasize, and with different amounts of time to reflect on what he had seen then and since.

In the account contained in the Joseph Smith-History, he emphasizes this as the beginning of the rise of the Church.  In the earliest account written in an unpublished autobiography, his focus was on the forgiveness of his sins and the love of God.

It does not surprise me that telling a story multiple times over the course of many years that the words used are not the same, and the point of the story would be different depending on the size of the audience and the reason for telling the story.  Smaller audiences include more private details.  Formal settings are different from informal ones.

The Church’s Gospel Topics Essays contain [a description of the different accounts](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/first-vision-accounts?lang=eng), why they differ, an explanation of the complaints that some have given, and a response to those complaints.

FairMormon.org’s study resources also have [a good take](https://www.fairmormon.org/come-follow-me-doctrine-covenants-church-history/doctrine-and-covenants-2-come-follow-me) on the consistencies between the accounts and a summary of the thing that was most important to Joseph: God’s love.
