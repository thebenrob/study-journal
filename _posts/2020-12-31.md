If I am humble, the Lord’s chastening can lead me to repent
Doctrine & Covenants 1:3, 24-28, 31-33

## Repentance

Repentance = changing for the better

* V24 - “these commandments...were given unto my servants in their weakness...that they might come to understanding”
* V26 - “And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed”
* V27 - “And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent”
* V28 - “And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge”

## Perfection

We don’t need to be perfect yet, but we do need to be headed in the right direction.  The requirements are simple, but there’s not a lot of leeway.

* V31 - “I the Lord cannot looks upon sin with the least degree of allowance” - this makes more sense if we assume that God does not make the rules (Skousen again).
* V32 - “he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven” - In order for Christ to advocate for us, we must repent (change) and obey the commandments.
* V33 - If we don’t repent (change), then we will diminish/fade - “from him shall be taken even the light which he has received”
