The Book of Mormon contains “the fulness of the everlasting Gospel”
Joseph Smith History 1:34-65

This part contains the story of the Angel Moroni’s visits to Joseph Smith to reveal the existence of the Book of Mormon, to teach him and prepare him to receive the plates, and to retrieve them after Joseph had translated them.  It also includes Martin Harris’s story about having taken the characters and translation to a few professors who certified the translation, but then found out the origin of it and retracted their statements.

One fun detail that has previously eluded me was that Emma’s family was very much against her getting married to Joseph such that they had to elope and be married somewhere else.  Then later when he had to leave Manchester to go live with her family, I’ve never imagined the kind of personal strain that would have been involved.  Because he certainly didn’t have enough to worry about already.

The Isaiah reference is also fun.  [Isaiah 29:4, 11-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/29.11-18?lang=eng). An instance where the fulfillment of the prophecy is so tailored to the wording of  the original.  It’s almost as if the Lord is making sure that we can’t miss it.
