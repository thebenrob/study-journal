# He Could Heal Me

[He Could Heal Me!](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/24meurs?lang=eng)
> How does the Savior’s healing power apply to our accidental mistakes, challenges, and trials of every kind?

## What does healing mean?
The Savior’s “Healing” power is referred to in many different contexts:
* Physical infirmities
* Mistakes
* Weakness
* Challenges/Trials
* Sin

These are not mutually exclusive, they intersect and overlap and compound on one another
* Physical infirmities can lead to challenges and trials
* Weakness can lead to sin
* Sin can lead to challenges and trials
* Mistakes can lead to sin or to challenges and trials
* You get the picture

## Let’s start where Elder Meurs starts
* Jesus visits the people in the Americas
* He is done preaching for the day and says that he’s got some other visits to make (to the Father and to the other lost tribes of Israel)

[3 Nephi 17:5-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=5-9)
> **5** And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.
> 
> **6** And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.
> 
> **7** Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.
> 
> **8** For I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient that I should heal you.
> 
> **9** And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.

* I want to emphasize that last point - they were healed “every one”
* This was a public event, but also a very private/individual one
* It is after this - in the same chapter - that Jesus blesses their little children one by one and angels come to minister

## Elder Meurs’ story
* Living in Sale Australia (south eastern coast)
* Beautiful summer day just before Christmas, they pack their 4 kids in the car and head to the parks and the beach
* They have a great day and head for home, but Elder Meurs falls asleep at the wheel and causes a head on collision
* He has some minor injuries, 3 daughters are in shock, but mostly OK
* His wife has a badly broken leg, a broken sternum and is having trouble breathing
* Their 5-month old child is unresponsive
* He and his daughters manage to get out of the car, his wife can’t be moved
* His oldest daughter (11) says he needs to give Jarom a blessing
> Carefully I picked Jarom up; then, while lying on the ground on my back, I gently placed him on my chest and gave him a priesthood blessing. By the time the ambulance arrived about 40 minutes later, Jarom was conscious.
> 
> That night I left three family members in the hospital and took a hushed taxi ride home with two of my daughters. Through the long night, I pled with Heavenly Father that my family and those injured in the other vehicle would recover. Mercifully, my prayers and fervently offered prayers by many others were answered. All were healed over time, a great blessing and tender mercy.
> 
> Yet I continued to have deep feelings of guilt and remorse for causing such a terrible accident. I would wake during the night and relive the horrific events. I struggled for years to forgive myself and to find peace. Then, as a priesthood leader, while assisting others to repent and helping them to feel the compassion, mercy, and love of the Savior, I realized that He could heal me.
> 
> The Savior’s healing and redeeming power applies to accidental mistakes, poor decisions, challenges, and trials of every kind—as well as to our sins. As I turned to Him, my feelings of guilt and remorse were gradually replaced with peace and rest.

## We Do This Too

I think this happens to everybody all the time.
* We tell the stories of Jesus from primary on up
* We bear our testimonies of Him and His love and His sacrifice and his matchless power
* We thank him for His sacrifice for us
* And we still don’t realize what it means for us
* I think we know what it means for us intellectually or academically - when somebody asks the question, we can tell them and give them the answer
* But so often we don’t let it actually change our lives - we don’t let him into our lives in the day-to-day to heal us

I also want to be sure to call out that healing is not he same as happily ever after here.  Many of you already have had experiences with the healing power of Christ and know from personal experience that it doesn’t mean happily ever after.  Elder Meurs used the word “gradual” to describe his personal healing process.  

I personally believe that being “healed” here means that we can get back on our feet again and keep going.  To borrow words from Paul, I think it means that we can continue to fight the good fight and keep the faith until we have finished our course.

I want to tell a few stories about what He said he would do and a few about what it could look like to live differently - to take him at his word and let Him in.  Some of them I hope you’ve heard before.  Others I hope are new.  And I hope that at something I say can speak to your heart and give you a view of what it could mean for you, individually if we will let him in to heal us.

## #1

* Let’s go to the beginning of Jesus’ mortal ministry
* As far as the Jews know, they are all that remains of the broken house of Israel, subject to the Romans and praying for the coming of their Messiah to deliver them (like they had been delivered from Pharaoh in Egypt and so many other times in their history)
* Jesus has just been baptized, heard the Father say “Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased”
* He’s been in the wilderness, fasting and communing with his father for 40 days, been harassed by the devil
* Now he’s back in Nazareth, where he grew up and is ready to begin his ministry in earnest
* And how does he do it?
* This is a great scene in The Chosen if you’re watching that show
* He stands up to preach in the synagogue and quotes from Isaiah a scripture that every Jew who knew the Torah knew well and understood to be a scripture that referenced their coming Messiah
* He could have said so many things, as he opens his ministry, he chooses these specific words to announce his mission.

[Luke 4:18-21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/4?lang=eng&id=18-21) - [Isaiah 61:1-2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/61?lang=eng&id=1-2)
> **18** The Spirit of the Lord *is* upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,
> 
> **19** To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.

* Then he closes the book and everyone is staring at him and he says: “This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.”  
* For these people this is a simple and clear declaration that he is the Messiah they’ve been waiting for
* There’s a riot of sorts, they condemn Him to death for his blasphemy, they take him to a nearby cliff to toss him off
* But he escapes

## #2

* We go now to the Book of Mormon
* Abinadi preaches to the people of King Noah and tells them to repent, they harden their hearts
* Abinadi is thrown in prison and then brought before the King to be questioned
* He speaks boldy to them
* They get angry and are going to kill him
* He says “Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent me to deliver”
* He teaches them the commandments again because he says that they aren’t written in their hearts
* Then he quotes Isaiah and says this:

[Mosiah 14:4-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/14?lang=eng&id=4-5) - Also [Isaiah 53:4-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/53?lang=eng&id=3-5)
> **4** Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
> 
> **5** But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.
 
* Now who is listening to all this?  Alma is listening.  And Alma believes and pleads for Abinadi’s life
* Noah kills Abinadi and tries to kill Alma who runs away
* Alma begins to teach in secret, baptizes at the Waters of Mormon and is eventually run out by Noah
* The words of Abinadi changed the entire direction of Alma’s life - but *I think* this scripture from Isaiah in particular - why do I think that?
* I’m taking some liberties here
* Alma the Younger is a bad kid, working to destroy the Church, sees an angel and he falls to the Earth

[Alma 36:12-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=12-15)
He describes the experience later as:
> …being racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins…yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.  Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God”

* And what is it that brings him out of it?  The words which he remembered his father saying about Jesus Christ.  I think that maybe some of those words that Alma the Elder spoke so much may have been the ones he heard from Abinadi on the day that *his* life had changed forever.
* Hear it again as Alma the Younger would have

[Mosiah 14:4-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/14?lang=eng&id=4-5) - Also [Isaiah 53:4-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/53?lang=eng&id=3-5)
> **4** Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
> 
> **5** But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are ==healed==.

* And what is the effect? Listen to what Alma says as he opens up - he had heard the words before - knew it academically if you will - could have given the answer if he’d been asked.  Listen to what happens now when he really *applies* it:

* [Alma 36:17-21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=17-21)
> **17** And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.
> 
> **18** Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.
> **19** And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.
> 
> **20** And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!
> 
> **21** Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.

* And later in life, when Alma is the high priest over the church and preaching to his people (in the land of Gideon)  he gives one of my favorite descriptions of why Jesus came to Earth

[Alma 7:11-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=11-12)
> **11** And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; 

Not just physical, but mental, emotional, spiritual…every kind - he “descended below *all* things”. Why does Alma say he does this?

> and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.

This is Isaiah again, the same scripture.  Alma the Younger is quoting the same scripture that Abinadi quoted to Noah, that changed his dad’s life, then changed his life, and he wants the people to understand this message.

> **12** And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.

## #3

* Back to the life of Jesus for our next story of Jesus ability to heal us from sin - or a parable anyway, that Jesus wanted us to understand about how happy He is when we repent (change) and open our hearts to Him so He can heal us
* The pharisees and scribes are condemning Jesus for eating with publicans and sinners
* He gives the parable of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son - the last one which today we often call the prodigal son
* A man has two sons, the younger takes his inheritance early, runs off and wastes it all in “riotous living”
* There’s a famine and the son is brought to very humble circumstances, working for a man to feed the swine is his field and wishing that he could eat the same food that the swine are eating
* “And when came to himself”, realizing what he’s lost through his selfish actions

[Luke 15:20-24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/15?lang=eng&id=20-24)
> **20** And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
> 
> **21** And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.
> 
> **22** But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put *it* on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on *his* feet:
> 
> **23** And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill *it;* and let us eat, and be merry:
> 
> **24** For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.

## #4

* One more story from the life of Jesus - this one is a healing of a physical infirmity, but I believe it also demonstrates the overlapping nature of our infirmities and Jesus’ power to heal all types
* This is also a great scene in The Chosen
* Jairus has just one daughter who is terribly sick - he falls at Jesus feet and begs him to come and heal his daughter - this story is not about Jairus, but it could be
* While Jesus is on his way to Jairus’ house, he is approached by the “woman having an issue of blood”
* At the time, the Jewish people considered women who were on their menstrual cycle to be ritually unclean
* They were expected to keep themselves physically and socially separate from everyone around them at risk of spreading their uncleanness
* And this woman has been a social outcast - through no fault of her own - for the last 12 years
* This woman, having heard of Jesus’s miracles violates this expectation to press through the crowd - praying that she can only touch his robe as he passes
* She succeeds and is immediately healed - “her issue of blood stanched”

> **45** And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press *thee,* and sayest thou, Who touched me?
> 
> **46** And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.

Now, I don’t think Jesus is in the dark about what’s happened here.  But this healing is not just physical and for him to accomplish the next part of the healing, he needs everyone else to know what’s just happened.

> **47** And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.
> 
> **48** And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.

Here Jesus is declaring to the entire crowd, that this woman - who has been unclean for 12 years and everybody knows it - is not unclean anymore.  She has been made whole.  Now, I don’t think 12 years of being a social outcast is forgotten in a moment, but I think this is at least the beginning of an emotional healing that this woman also needs - though her path to “fully healed” may still be long.

## #5

Stephen E. Robinson - recently passed away in 2018.  
* He taught at BYU for many years, he served as chairmen of the Department of Ancient Scripture there
* I first learned of him from his book “Believing Christ” which is somewhat of an inspiration for my message today
* The point is that we need to actually believe that Christ can and will do for us what he said he will do
* If you’re familiar with the parable of the bicycle, that came from this book (the kid who wants to buy a bike, and his Dad tells him to save his money, and after saving for so long, the kid still doesn’t have enough money, but his Dad takes what he’s saved and then he makes up the rest)
  * Except that it’s not a parable, it’s a real story about him and his daughter Sarah
* There are two other stories in it what I want to share.  The first is about Jesus’ power to heal us from sin.

[Believing Christ: A Practical Approach to the Atonement](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/stephen-e-robinson/believing-christ-practical-approach-atonement/)

> First is a story about my son, Michael, who did something wrong when he was six or seven years old. He’s my only son, and I’m hard on him. I want him to be better than his dad was, even as a boy, and so I lean on him and expect a great deal. Well, he had done something I thought was incredibly [bad], and I let him know how terrible it was. I sent him to his room with the instructions, “Don’t you dare come out until I come and get you.”
> 
> And then I forgot. It was some hours later, as I was watching television, that I heard his door open and heard the tentative footsteps coming down the hall. I said, “Oh, my gosh,” and ran to my end of the hall to see him standing with swollen eyes and tears on his cheeks at the other end. He looked up at me—he wasn’t quite sure he should have come out—and said, “Dad, can’t we ever be friends again?” Well, I melted, ran to him, and hugged him. He’s my boy, and I love him.
> 
> Like Michael, we all do things that disappoint our Father, that separate us from his presence and spirit. There are times when we get sent to our rooms spiritually. There are sins that maim; there are sins that wound our spirits. Some of you know what it is like to do something that makes you feel as if you just drank raw sewage. You can wash, but you can never get clean. When that happens, sometimes we ask the Lord as we lift up our eyes, “O Father, can’t we ever be friends again?”
> 
> The answer that can be found in all the scriptures is a resounding “Yes, through the Atonement of Christ.” I particularly like the way it is put in Isaiah 1:18.
> 
> *Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.*

This one is about Jesus’ power to heal us when we feel we are broken beyond repair.  From Stephen E. Robinson again:

[Believing Christ: A Practical Approach to the Atonement](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/stephen-e-robinson/believing-christ-practical-approach-atonement/)

> My wife and I were living in Pennsylvania. Things were going pretty well; I’d been promoted. It was a good year for us, though a trying year for Janet. That year she had our fourth child, graduated from college, passed the CPA exam, and was made Relief Society president. We had temple recommends, we had family home evening. I was in the bishopric. I thought we were headed for “LDS yuppiehood.” Then one night the lights went out. Something happened in my wife that I can only describe as “dying spiritually.” She wouldn’t talk about it; she wouldn’t tell me what was wrong. That was the worst part. For a couple of weeks she did not wish to participate in spiritual things. She asked to be released from her callings, and she would not open up and tell me what was wrong.
> 
> Finally, after about two weeks, one night I made her mad and it came out. She said, “All right. You want to know what’s wrong? I’ll tell you what’s wrong. I can’t do it anymore. I can’t lift it. I can’t get up at 5:30 in the morning and bake bread and sew clothes and help my kids with their homework and do my own homework and do my Relief Society stuff and get my genealogy done and write the congressman and go to the PTA meetings and write the missionaries . . .” And she just started naming one brick after another that had been laid on her, explaining all the things she could not do. She said, “I don’t have the talent that Sister Morrell has. I can’t do what Sister Childs does. I try not to yell at the kids, but I lose control, and I do. I’m just not perfect, and I’m not ever going to be perfect. I’m not going to make it to the celestial kingdom, and I’ve finally admitted that to myself. You and the kids can go, but I can’t lift it. I’m not ‘Molly Mormon,’ and I’m not ever going to be perfect, so I’ve given up. Why break my back?”
> 
> Well, we started to talk, and it was a long night. I asked her, “Janet, do you have a testimony?”
> 
> She said, “Of course I do! That’s what’s so terrible. I know it’s true. I just can’t do it.”
> 
> “Have you kept the covenants you made when you were baptized?”
> 
> She said, “I’ve tried and I’ve tried, but I cannot keep all the commandments all the time.”
> 
> Then I rejoiced because I knew what was wrong, and I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. It wasn’t any of those horrible things I thought it might be. Who would have thought after eight years of marriage, after all the lessons we’d given and heard, and after all we had read and done in the Church, who would have thought that Janet did not know the gospel of Jesus Christ? You see, she was trying to save herself. She knew why Jesus is a coach, a cheerleader, an advisor, a teacher. She knew why he is an example, the head of the Church, the Elder Brother, or even God. She knew all of that, but she did not understand why he is called the *Savior.*
> 
> Janet was trying to save herself with Jesus as an advisor. Brothers and sisters, we can’t. No one can.

President Nelson from [The Power of Spiritual Momentum](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson?lang=eng) - April 2022
> When the Savior atoned for all mankind, He opened a way that those who follow Him can have access to His healing, strengthening, and redeeming power. These spiritual privileges are available to all who seek to hear Him and follow Him.

How do we do this?

[Matthew 11:28-30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/11?lang=eng&id=28-30)
> **28** ¶ Come unto me, all *ye* that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
> 
> **29** Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
> 
> **30** For my yoke *is* easy, and my burden is light.

[Doctrine and Covenants 112:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112?lang=eng&id=13#p13)

Instructions to Joseph for the 12 apostles as they are sent out to raise the warning voice to all nations and peoples
> **13** And after their temptations, and much tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts, and stiffen not their necks against me, they shall be converted, and I will heal them.

[3 Nephi 18:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=32#p32)

Instructions from Jesus on what to do with those who have sinned
> **32** Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.

Elder Patrick Kearon from his talk [He Is Risen with Healing in His Wings: We Can Be More Than Conquerors](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/24kearon?lang=eng) - April 2022
> Dear friends who have been so terribly wounded—and for that matter, anyone who has borne the injustices of life—you can have a new beginning and a fresh start. In Gethsemane and on Calvary, Jesus “took upon Himself … *all* of the anguish and suffering *ever* experienced by you and me,” and He has overcome it all! With arms outstretched, the Savior offers the gift of healing to you. With courage, patience, and faithful focus on Him, before too long you can come to fully accept this gift. You can let go of your pain and leave it at His feet.
> 
> Your gentle Savior declared, “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that [you] might have life, and that [you] might have it more abundantly. You are a survivor, you can heal, and you can trust that with the power and grace of Jesus Christ, you will overcome and conquer.
> 
> Jesus specializes in the seemingly impossible. He came here to make the impossible possible, the irredeemable redeemable, to heal the unhealable, to right the unrightable, to promise the unpromisable.  And He’s really good at it. In fact, He’s perfect at it.

I know that Jesus can heal us.  I pray that we will let him.
