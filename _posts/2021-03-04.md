Priesthood service blesses church members and their families.
Doctrine & Covenants 20:38-60

I remember being told to read these verses as a kid so I could “learn my duty”.  I wondered how the things in there related to what I was asked to do.  Everybody knows that Deacons are supposed to pass the sacrament, but that’s not mentioned.  Teacher’s preparing the sacrament isn’t mentioned either.

Reading through it now, one interesting thing that stands out is that Priests are to assist Elders whenever the occasion requires.  Verse 52:
> In all these duties the priest is to ​​​assist​ the elder if occasion requires.

Same for Deacons to assist Teachers.  Verse 57:
> And is to be assisted always, in all his duties in the church, by the ​​​deacons​, if occasion requires.

No mention of whether Teachers are to assist Priests if occasion requires.  Does that mean no? Or it just means we’re supposed to infer it?  And what does that even mean anyway?  Deacons should help prepare the sacrament if there aren’t enough Teachers and Priests around?

Priests don’t have the Melchizedek Priesthood, so they obviously can’t assist Elders in anything even if the occasion does require?

So many questions =)
