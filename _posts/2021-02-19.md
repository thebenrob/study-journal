The Lord uses witnesses to establish His word
Doctrine & Covenants 17

It was foretold in the Book of Mormon that there would be three special witnesses.

* 2 Nephi 27:12-13
* Ether 5:2-4

The three witnesses were promised that they could see:

* The plates
* The breastplate
* The sword of Laban
* The Urim and Thummim (given to the Brother of Jared upon the mount)
* The Liahona (miraculous directors)

The made a covenant of sorts - though I haven’t heard it referred to that way before - but in exchange for seeing these things they are told that they must “testify that you have seen them” and that “he has translated the book”.
