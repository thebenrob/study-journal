If I ask in faith, God will answer
Joseph Smith History 1:5-20

My first thought was that I lack wisdom all the time.  I’ve never had an answer that was anything like Joseph’s, but I’ve also never expected one.  For some reason, I can believe that it happened to Joseph, but have no belief that anything like that would (could?) happen to me.

I’ve also probably never put in the effort that Joseph did.  The statement that he kept himself aloof from the parties while attending their meetings as often as occasion would permit, probably spans actual months in real time.  Months that he spend reading, attending meetings, pondering, and “laboring under the extreme difficulties”.

For the most part, my approach to situations like this is:

1. Get as much information as I can
2. Weigh pros and cons, sometimes over days and weeks depending on the size/impact of the decision
3. Make a decision about what I think is best
4. Pray for confirmation (and honestly, sometimes I forget this step)
5. Proceed with my decision unless something happens that I can interpret as a sign from God that I’m headed in the wrong direction

This feels a lot less “faithful” or “spiritual” than what it seems Joseph’s approach was.  It feels like I’m more reliant on man than God.  But it seems that’s all I’ve got to go on.
