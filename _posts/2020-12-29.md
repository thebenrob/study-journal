God speaks through His servants, and His words will be fulfilled
D&C 1:1-6, 23-24, 37-39

## The Lord has authority to all people

* V1 - “ye people of my church, ye people from afar, ye that are upon the isles of the sea
* V2 - “the voice of the Lord is unto all men”
* V4 - “the voice of warning shall be unto all people”
* V23 - “proclaimed...unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers”

## The Lord speaks through the mouths of his disciples by commandment

* V4 - “the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen”
* V5 - “they shall go forth..., for I the Lord have commanded them”
* V24 - “these commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants”

## The servants authority is the same as the Lords

* V6 - “this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants” - I understand this to be a declaration that V1-5 are actually declaration of the /scope/ of His (and His servants) authority - meaning, this is the realm which He has responsibility for - all inhabitants of Earth
* V38 - “whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same”

## The Lord’s authority is complete

* V38 - “What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself” - I think today we might say “I make no excuse for myself” - this is typically said by someone who in a position of leadership who understands consequences, but still knows what must be done

## Times I’ve heard the voice of the Lord through his servants (from the hip)

* When I received my patriarchal blessing
* When Elder Robbins spoke in a Stake conference discussing how to hear the voice of the Lord (“bing”)
* When President Sloan talked about repentance = change
