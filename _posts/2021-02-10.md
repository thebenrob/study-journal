## D&C 84:26-27

* The gospel of repentance is also called the preparatory gospel
* It is the gospel of repentance, baptism, the remission of sins, and “the law of carnal commandments”

> An Aaronic Priesthood holder covenants to avoid evil, help others be reconciled to God, and prepare to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood. These sacred responsibilities are fulfilled as he teaches, baptizes, strengthens Church members, and invites others to accept the gospel...In return, God promises hope, forgiveness, the ministering of angels, and the keys of the gospel of repentance and baptism.
