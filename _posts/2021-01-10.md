Spiritual Thought for Ward Council

* Conversation with a neighbor who made some political comments that I felt were racist and bigoted
* I assumed my standard politically passive state neither agreeing nor disagreeing with what was being said and looking for a graceful exit to the conversation as quickly as possible
* This is the same week we’re studying the 1st section of the Doctrine & Covenants and we discussed with the kids how God is no respecter of persons (v35) and what that means
* Fast forward to Wednesday, where groups who are well known for their white nationalism and support of racist ideas break into the nation’s capital in an attempt to prevent the peaceful transfer of power to a new leader they disagree with
* And then Thursday, I got to attend an endowment session at the temple for my niece who is going on a mission, and see there on the screen a specific image of people from all cultures all over the Earth as the voices of our Heavenly Father and Jesus talk about creating man and women in their own likeness and image
* And we have many statements from our church leaders - President Nelson and President Oaks most recently, but there are many - condemning racism in all its forms and reaffirming God’s love for all his children and the duty that we have as church members to root out racism
* And it all goes back to what Jesus said himself while he was here - Pharisees and Saducees were taking turns trying to trip Jesus up with different points of law, on one of the Pharisees turns, they asked “Master, which is the great commandment in the law?” [Matthew 22:36-40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22.37,39?lang=eng#p37)
* On another occasion when Jesus was asked “Who is my neighbor?” Jesus gave the parable of the Good Samaritan and we have interpreted that parable for as long as I can remember to say that the answer is everyone.  Everyone is my neighbor.
* All of this is to say, that I have identified a gap between my knowledge and my behavior.  I know that I should love my neighbor, but when presented with an everyday opportunity to express that, I did not.
* Since President Nelson’s recent talk on doing and being better, whenever I hear the word “repent” I swap it in my mind with the word “change”.  So to say that differently, I’ve identified a need to repent.
* Jeremy unknowingly twisted the knife a little in Bishopric meeting when he referenced Elder Bednar’s talk [More Diligent and Concerned at Home](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2009/10/more-diligent-and-concerned-at-home?lang=eng)
** As disciples of the Savior, we are not merely striving to know more; rather, we need to consistently do more of what we know is right and become better.
* So with a new year, as we look for opportunities to improve ourselves, I want to encourage everyone to look for a gap between what you know and what we do and take the opportunity to repent.
