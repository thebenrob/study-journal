I should take the sacrament with an eye single to God’s glory
Doctrine & Covenants 27:1-4

It has been several days since my last study session. Several of the kids have gone back to school full-time, and that threw a wrench in my morning routines. I still haven’t figured out exactly how to adjust, but I’m sneaking this in.

There are a few things about this section that I find interesting.

The study guide explains that Emma and Sally Knight were baptized in June 1830. Their baptism was disrupted by a mob, and their confirmations were not able to be performed.

A few months later Sally and her husband came to visit Joseph and Emma. There confirmations were completed and they decided to take the sacrament. Joseph left to get wine for the sacrament. On his way an angel stopped him. The words of the angel are section 27.

The thing that is striking about this to me is the way the revelation came. It seems that the Lord speaks directly when you seek him out in prayer and faith. But if He needs to interrupt you, He’ll send an angel to do that.

Based on earlier study about the ministering of angels, that angel could be a heavenly messenger or an earthly one.
