The Restoration of the gospel fulfilled ancient prophecies
Joseph Smith History 1:36-41

When the Prophet Moroni visited Joseph Smith, he quoted a bunch of scripture with some tweaks and some additional commentary.  These are generally about the Restoration, the Messenger of the Lord, and the Second Coming.  More specifically:

1. [Malachi 3:??](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3) - this is about a messenger of the Lord preparing the way for his coming and a warning about what happens when the Lord comes again
2. [Malachi 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/4) - with some variation - this is more about what happens at the second coming, but also the note that Elijah will return before then
3. [Isaiah 11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/11) - that it was about to be fulfilled - by my read, this is a prophecy about the Restoration, especially verse 11 where the Lord sets his hand a second time to recover a remnant of his people.  Also references to the second coming.
4. [Acts 3:22-23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/3?id=p22-p23#p22) - the prophet was Christ, but the day had not yet come, but soon would, when those who would not hear his voice would be cut off - by my read this is about the final judgment
5. [Joel 2:28-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/2?id=p28-p32#p28) - this was not yet fulfilled, but was about to be - this prophecy seems to be about all those who follow the Lord being able to receive revelation and a warning about the events preceding the second coming

I have never actually read these scriptures before in this context.

The Lord had already told Joseph that he had a work for him to do, but had not been specific (to my knowledge) about what that work was.  Moroni is starting to explain that here, though maybe not explicitly saying that it would be Joseph doing it, but maybe Joseph was starting to get the hint.

Moroni is explaining the plates pretty explicitly about what is coming immediately next, but he is also offering hints about some of what’s coming after that.  About what the work of the Lord actually is, and what Joseph will be expected to accomplish before his part in it is done.  Given the nature of the work, one might expect it would take Joseph some time to “wrap his head around it”.
