The Church of Jesus Christ is led by a living prophet.
Doctrine & Covenants 21

Verses 4-6
> 4 Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking in all holiness before me;
> 5 For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and faith.
> 6 For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name’s glory.

The Prophet gives words and commandments as he receives them from the Lord, and we should treat his words with the weight they deserve.

The Prophet is a man, and he can speak as a man.  We would do well to keep that in mind.

But the Prophet is not just a man.  He is also a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator.  We would do well to also keep this in mind.  And when he speaks as a Prophet - which is most of the time that we will actually see him or hear him directly - we should remember that he is speaking the Lord’s words.

I should remember that when I listen to his conference addresses.  That should change the way that I treat those words.
