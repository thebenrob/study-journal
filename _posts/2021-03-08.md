That Savior can lift me “up out of [my] afflictions”
Doctrine & Covenants 24

Verses 1-3: Being lifted up out of our afflictions first requires that we have afflictions.  This is not a promise that bad things won’t happen.  Rather the Lord says he will deliver us from enemies, powers of Satan, and darkness.  They will not prevail against us, but we will definitely struggle with them.

Verse 8: This is maybe simultaneously the most depressing and encouraging scripture around.

* Depressing: Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have many
* Encouraging: I am with thee, even unto the end of they days

Again, the Lord makes it very clear that this journey is not for the faint of heart.  What’s the famous saying? “I never said it would be easy.  I only said it would be worth it.”

D&C 121:7-8: thine adversity and thine affliction shall be but small moment...if thou endure it well, God shall exalt the on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.

Isaiah 40:28-31: ...they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk and not faint.

Mosiah 24:14-15: This is the story of Alma’s people in their bondage to the Lamanites in the land of Helam.  “...the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.”
