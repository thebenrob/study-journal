I can gain my own witness of the Book of Mormon
Doctrine & Covenants 5

## Human Nature

The Lord understands human nature (seems plausible since he created them).  
> 7 Behold, if they will not  my words, they would not believe you, my servant Joseph, if it were possible that you should show them all these things which I have committed unto you.

Restating this in modern parlance might go something like this:
> Look, if they’re not going to believe my words, they’re not going to believe you either, even if you could show them everything you know.  Either they will believe or they won’t.  Seeing the plates isn’t going to change that.

## Witnesses Are Important

* V11 - three witnesses will be called and ordained, then they must go forth
* V12 - they will know of a surety because it will be declared from heaven
* V14 - none else will receive this power
