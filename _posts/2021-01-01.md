The Lord restored His gospel to help me face the challenges of the latter days
Doctrine & Covenants 1:12-30, 35-36

## Weak things

* V19 - “The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones”
* V24 - “these commandments...were given unto my servants in their weakness...that they might come to understanding”
* The Lord refers to His servants as weak, I think this refers both to their numbers (they are few) and their worldly capabilities (they are not rich, famous, learned, etc).
* ::?:: The commandments are not just for apostles and church leaders, they are for everyone, so am I also a servant?

What the Lord has given us to prepare

* Living Prophets - V17 - “[I] called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments”
* Missionary Work - V18 - “And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world”
* Book of Mormon - V29 - Joseph Smith is given power to translate the Book of Mormon
* Church (ordinances, covenants, the whole shebang) - V30 - those who are given the commandments are also given “power to lay the foundation of this church, to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole Earth” which the Lord is pleased with.
