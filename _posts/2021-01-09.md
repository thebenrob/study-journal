I can remain true to what I know, even if others reject me

## Prompt

What inspires you to remain true to your testimony? What other examples give you courage to stay true to the spiritual experiences you have had?

While Joseph possesses a strength of conviction and a courage that I do not have, I do feel a certain kinship with him.  I have had a few experiences - not glorious visions of heavenly personages - but experiences nonetheless where I felt something undeniable.  For which the most straightforward explanation is that there is a God in Heaven caring for us and guiding us.

There are experiences in my life about which I feel I can say what Joseph said.  
> For I had [felt the spirit undeniably]; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God.

These experiences form the pillars of my testimony.  Events in which I have yet to come across any other reasonable explanation for what I saw, heard, and felt.  When doubts arise, I fall back to these experiences to form the basis for what I do know.  And as Elder Holland says, I try to doubt my doubts before I doubt my testimony.
