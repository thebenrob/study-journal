Today I finished the video in the intro to the study guide.  As the work of translation continued, persecution and threats against Joseph continued to mount in Harmony.  In this backdrop of persecution, Oliver Cowdery seeks reassurance that what he is doing is right and receives a revelation that quiets his doubts.  Joseph and Oliver pray about baptism, receive the Aaronic Priesthood, and baptize one another.

Finally, Joseph seeks direction from the Lord who tells them to seek refuge at the Whitmer farm in Fayette, New York to complete the translation.  Joseph and Emma are parted for a few weeks, but reunited, and they finish the translation a few weeks after that.

Oliver’s doubt is what strikes me in this story.  The discomfort, persecution, and threats against Joseph are well portrayed, not as vague secret things, but openly and boldly.  Some of this is directed at Oliver as well.  The revelation that he receives, as well as his participation in the restoration of Priesthood, and his baptism must have gone a long way toward creating the resolve that would be needed.

Even before he actually saw the plates, it seems that his testimony was sure.  I guess I’d never thought much about the courage and resolve displayed by those closest to Joseph.  That would have been a significant challenge to - and test of - my faithfulness.
