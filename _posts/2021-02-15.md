I can participate in God’s “great and marvelous work”
Doctrine & Covenants 14

This is a revelation given to David Whitmer.  The study guide suggests that the work of the Lord is compared to farming because that is the kind of work that David was familiar with - a parable that David would understand, if you will.

As noted last week (2021-02-08), the Lord says this /a lot/ at the beginning of these revelations, so either the study guide is incorrect - or more likely - it just so happens that pretty much everybody was a farmer.  So it is the Lord’s preamble for these revelations, but he chose it as his preamble because it was a metaphor that everybody could understand.  Parable is probably not the right word, because it isn’t really designed to help some understand and conceal the meaning from others.

Verse 8 contains a specific promise to David that foreshadows his role as one of the three witnesses.

If you shall:

1. Ask the Father, in my name, in faith
2. Believing that you shall receive the Holy Ghost which give the utterance

Then:

1. You may stand as a witness of the things which you shall both hear and see
2. You may declare repentance unto this generation
