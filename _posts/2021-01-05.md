Joseph Smith is the Prophet of the Restoration
Joseph Smith History 1:1-26

## Opposition

I’ve read this a lot.  What stood out to me this time around were the asides he made about the opposition he faced from every side.  “All were united to persecute me.”  There was seemingly no encouragement coming from any quarter other than from his family.  And given that his father, mother, a brother, and sister had just become Presbyterians, you may have expected a less than warm reception from his family.  But they remained faithful to him.

As a total aside, I’ve always thought Don Carlos was a strange name for someone in his family, but for the first time wondered what circumstances led to his parents choosing that name for his brother.
