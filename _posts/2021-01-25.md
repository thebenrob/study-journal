Short entry today.  The introduction to this week’s study guide contains a video portraying the events that led Oliver Cowdery to Joseph Smith, and the beginning of the work that they did together.

It started with the death of Joseph’s children just prior to him learning about the pages of manuscript that had been lost.  I hadn’t before realized that he was going through such a deep personal tragedy at the same time period.

It contains many things, but the striking moment for me was when during translation, he reads that infants have no need of baptism because they are without sin (Moroni 8 is the place I know of where this doctrine is, but it might be somewhere else also).  One can imagine how happy he may have been to learn this information.

In the movie at least, he immediately leaves the table to go and find Emma to tell her what he has learned.  I don’t know if the scene is historically accurate, but certainly seems within the realm of possibility.

Previously, I haven’t thought much about Joseph’s personal life in connection with the work that he did.  That is a mistake I think.  How could those two things not be intimately connected.
