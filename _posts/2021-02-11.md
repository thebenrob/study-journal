## Aaronic Priesthood

[Guide to the Scriptures](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/gs/aaronic-priesthood)
The Aaronic Priesthood deals with the outward and temporal ordinances of the law and the gospel.
Perfection does not come by the Levitical Priesthood - Hebrews 7:11.  In this reference, it seems that Levitical may be used interchangeably with Aaronic.

## Levi

[Guide to the Scriptures](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/gs/levi)
Descendants of Levi ministered in the sanctuaries of Israel.  Aaron was a Levite and his descendants were priests.  The Levites assisted these priests.

The Levites acted as musicians, slaughtered sacrifices, and generally assisted in the temple.  They were dedicated to the service of the Lord to execute the ordinances for the children of Israel.  They were not consecrated, but were cleansed for their office.
